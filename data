#Appendix A: GTFS Datasets
The GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data exists in two main variants: the GTFS 
static (GTFS-s) feed and the GTFS real-time (GTFS-rt) feed.
A.1. GTFS Static (GTFS-s) Feed Files
The GTFS-s feed is typically a collection of comma-separated values (CSV) files containing 
relatively static information about a public transit (PT) network. This static information includes 
details that change infrequently, such as routes, stops, and schedules. Updates to these files 
may occur periodically, for example, when schedules are adjusted seasonally or when a new 
route is introduced.
The GTFS-s feed consists of several mandatory and optional files that together provide a 
comprehensive description of a PT network:
1. agency.txt: This file includes information about the transit agencies providing the data 
in the feed. Each transit agency is identified by an agency_id. It contains fields such as 
agency_name, agency_url, and agency_timezone, which describe the agency's name, 
website, and timezone, respectively.
2. routes.txt: Contains the routes within the PT network, each identified by a route_id. 
Routes represent a specific path taken by a PT vehicle, and this file includes fields such

as route_short_name, route_long_name, and route_type to provide a more detailed 
description of each route.
3. trips.txt: This file lists all the trips that occur on the routes in the PT network, each 
identified by a trip_id. A trip describes the movement of a PT vehicle along a specific 
route at a certain time. This file also includes fields such as service_id, trip_headsign, 
and direction_id.
4. stops.txt: Details all the stops in the PT network, each identified by a stop_id. This file 
provides information such as stop_name, stop_lat, and stop_lon, which indicate the 
stop's name and geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on the WGS 84 
datum.
5. stop_times.txt: Provides detailed scheduling information by listing the times that each 
trip stops at each stop. Each entry is identified by the associated trip_id and stop_id and 
includes fields such as arrival_time, departure_time, and stop_sequence.
6. calendar.txt (Conditionally Required): Defines the days of service for the trips, each 
identified by a service_id. This file specifies a weekly schedule, with fields indicating 
whether the service operates on each day of the week.
7. calendar_dates.txt (Conditionally Required): Provides exceptions to the regular 
schedule defined in calendar.txt, also associated with a service_id. This file includes 
fields such as date and exception_type to indicate specific dates when service is added 
or removed.
8. shapes.txt (Optional): Defines the physical path that the vehicle travels for each trip, 
identified by a shape_id. This file contains a series of points defined by shape_pt_lat 
and shape_pt_lon that outline the route's shape on a map.
9. feed_info.txt (Optional): Contains metadata about the dataset itself, including 
information such as feed_publisher_name, feed_publisher_url, and feed_version.
These files, when combined, provide a complete set of static information for a PT network. In a 
PT network, stops represent specific locations where passengers can board or disembark from 
PT vehicles. A route is defined by a fixed sequence of stops, and a trip represents a single 
journey along a route, occurring at a specific time.
A.2. GTFS Real-Time (GTFS-rt) Feed
While the GTFS-s feed provides static information about the transit network, the GTFS-rt feed 
supplies dynamic, real-time data collected during vehicle trips. This data is typically based on 
GPS tracking and provides up-to-the-minute updates on the status of the transit network. The 
GTFS-rt feed is used to provide passengers with current information about vehicle positions, 
service alerts, and trip updates. The real-time data is encoded using the Protocol Buffers 
(protobuf) format, an open-source standard for efficiently serializing structured data.
The GTFS-rt feed supports three main types of information:
1. Trip Updates: Include predicted arrival and/or departure times for stops along each trip. 
This data helps in estimating real-time ETAs (Estimated Time of Arrival) for each stop a 
vehicle will serve.
2. Vehicle Positions: Provide updates on the current location of individual transit vehicles. 
The data includes the vehicle's geographic coordinates and additional information like 
bearing and speed, allowing for real-time tracking of vehicles.
3. Service Alerts: Include updates on disruptions in the transit network, such as delays, 
detours, or route closures. These alerts are provided as human-readable messages that 
help passengers understand the current state of the transit network and plan their 
journeys accordingly.
By integrating the GTFS-s and GTFS-rt feeds, transit agencies can provide a comprehensive 
view of their operations, combining scheduled information with real-time updates to deliver 
accurate and reliable transit data to passengers.

Appendix B: Metro Transit
Metro Transit is the largest public transportation operator in Minnesota, serving the 
Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. The agency provides transit services, including buses, 
light rail, and commuter rail, and makes its transit data available in the General Transit Feed 
Specification (GTFS) format. This data can be accessed by the public through Metro Transit’s 
official website (MetroTransit, 2021).
